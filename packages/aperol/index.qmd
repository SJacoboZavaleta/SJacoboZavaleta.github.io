  A stylized illustration within an orange hexagonal frame. The word 'aperol' is written diagonally in green. Tere's a cocktail glass filled with an orange drink, ice cubes, and a slice of orange. The glass has a pink straw. Next to the glass is a whole orange with leaves and a pink flower. Small sparkles and stars are scattered around the image, giving it a festive feel. The color scheme is predominantly orange, green, and pink, creating a vibrant and summery atmosphere.

## Overview

A package that started as a joke, based on [this](https://fosstodon.org/@kellybodwin/112769186345818866) mastodon toot by Kelly Bodwin, asking what a package called {aperol} would do, and the subsequent suggestion by [Nick Tierney](https://aus.social/@njtierney/112770398923583882) that it should deliver praise, which [I ran with](https://fosstodon.org/@ellakaye/112771757956362352).

{aperol} gives you praise, but as if from someone tipsy or drunk. Specifically, it generates some praise using the [{praise}](https://github.com/rladies/praise) package and garbles it. `aperol::tipsy()` swaps a subset of words, and `aperol::drunk()` mixes up the whole affirmation, repeating some words along the way.

As of v0.2.0, there is an `aperol::spritz()` function, which is a wrapper to any other function (by default `devtools::check()`) which counts how many times you call it, and offers increasingly garbled praise, the more often you do so in a given time-frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aperol from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("EllaKaye/aperol")
```

## Examples

```{r example}
#| echo: true
library(aperol)
tipsy()
tipsy(swaps = 2, "${Exclamation}! ${EXCLAMATION}!-${EXCLAMATION}! This is just ${adjective}!")
drunk()
drunk(repeat_words = 2, repeat_times = 2:3)
drunk(2, 2, "You are ${creating} a ${adverb} ${adjective} ${rpackage}")
```

## The hex

The hex for the package (created by Kelly Bodwin) is so fun that here it is in its full-sized glory.
