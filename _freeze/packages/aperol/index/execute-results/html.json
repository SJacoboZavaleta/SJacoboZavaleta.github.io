The word 'aperol' is written diagonally in green. Tere's a cocktail glass filled with an orange drink, ice cubes, and a slice of orange. The glass has a pink straw. Next to the glass is a whole orange with leaves and a pink flower. Small sparkles and stars are scattered around the image, giving it a festive feel. The color scheme is predominantly orange, green, and pink, creating a vibrant and summery atmosphere.\n# N.B.

Specifically, it generates some praise using the [{praise}](https://github.com/rladies/praise) package and garbles it. `aperol::tipsy()` swaps a subset of words, and `aperol::drunk()` mixes up the whole affirmation, repeating some words along the way.\n\nAs of v0.2.0, there is an `aperol::spritz()` function, which is a wrapper to any other function (by default `devtools::check()`) which counts how many times you call it, and offers increasingly garbled praise, the more often you do so in a given time-frame.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the development version of aperol from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"EllaKaye/aperol\")\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(aperol)\ntipsy()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"exquisite! are swiftly You\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntipsy(swaps = 2, \"${Exclamation}! ${EXCLAMATION}!-${EXCLAMATION}! This is just ${adjective}!\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Yeahyah!
