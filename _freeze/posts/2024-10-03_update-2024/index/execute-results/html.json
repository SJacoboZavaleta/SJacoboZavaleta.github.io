I'm now reflecting on the last twelve months^[Since it's Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year)] and catching up with a bumper blog post on what I've been working on over the last year.\n\n## Base R contributions\nI'm now two years into my role as a Research Software Engineer, working with Heather Turner on her fellowship project \"Sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) in the R Project\". The main goal of the fellowship is to foster a newer and more diverse community of collaborators to base R, and it's closely aligned with the work of the [R Contribution Working Group](https://contributor.r-project.org).\n\nI've been involved in a few R developer events, which have lead to two patches that I co-authored being accepted into base R. **LINKS**. Even though the patches are pretty minor, it's a thrill to be able at contribute to the base of this language which I love so much.\n\n## Learning C\n\nThe contributions referred to above both involve making edits to C code, though neither required a much knowledge of that language. Because I'm always looking to improve as a programmer, and in particular to be able to have a deeper understanding of the C code upon which R is built, I spent the beginning of the year learning C. I did this through participating in the C for R users study group, working through weeks 1-5 of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/), Harvard's excellent Introduction to Computer Science course.\n\nThis was a commitment I made as I [wrapped up last year's Advent of Code](../2023-12-30_advent-of-code-2023/index.qmd) and, as I planned, I did started to work through the 2015 run of Advent of Code. I was making good progress -- 16 puzzled solved in R and 8 also solved in C-- when other projects overtook that one in importance. I haven't yet updated [my Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.ellakaye.co.uk) with blogs about my 2015 solutions, though the solutions themselves are on [GitHub](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code/tree/main/2015).^[I enjoy coding more than I enjoy writing blog posts, so the temptation was always to move onto the next challenge, rather than write up the one I'd just completed.] It is a project I would like to return to at some point.\n\n## Learning Python\n\nI enjoyed the first five weeks of CS50 so much that I decided to complete the course, and therefore also learnt some Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flask.\n\nFor my CS50 final project, I decided to revisit the first ever programming project I undertook, back in 2013 -- an implementation in Python of a patience^[Or solitaire, if you're in North America] card game. It's newbie code, and I wanted to bring it up-to-date, learning current Pythonic best practice, and bringing to bear all that I've learnt about programming over the last decade. I was about 90-95% of the way to finishing an implementation using the Python Arcade games engine, when my attention was caught by an announcement about the 2024 Shiny Contest and I decided to reimplement the game once again in Shiny for Python. I thought I was done with that version -- it was working perfectly on my laptop -- but when I uploaded it to Posit Connect Cloud, the slower speeds lead to a visual glitch. It's fixable, but requires refactoring much of the code-base, and I'll also need to learn some JavaScript. \n\nI've paused development of the game while I go back and take a more structured approach to learning what I need -- I have almost completed the [CS50 Python course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), and next I'll work through [CS50 Web](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/). \n\nI'd like to finish (the original) CS50 by the end of 2024, and I don't think I'll get theShiny for Python version done to my satisfaction in that time-frame. I'm planning on going back and completing the Python Arcade implementation, then returning to the Shiny version once I've done CS50 Web.\n\n## rainbowR\n\n## Conferences\n\n## Packages\n\n## SSI Inclusive\n\n## The rest\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n## Last updated {.appendix}\n \n2024-10-03 15:38:31.172241\n \n## Details {.appendix}\n \n[source code](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk/tree/main/posts/2024-10-03_update-2024/index.qmd){target='_blank'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Session info {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Toggle</summary>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)\n os       macOS 15.0\n system   aarch64, darwin20\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       Europe/London\n date     2024-10-03\n pandoc   3.2 @ /Applications/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n quarto   1.5.54 @ /usr/local/bin/quarto\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n ! package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n P sessioninfo * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [?] CRAN (R 4.4.0)\n\n [1] /Users/ellakaye/Projects/mine/ellakaye.co.uk/renv/library/R-4.4/aarch64-apple-darwin20\n [2] /Users/ellakaye/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/sandbox/R-4.4/aarch64-apple-darwin20/f7156815\n\n P ── Loaded and on-disk path mismatch.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n\n",
