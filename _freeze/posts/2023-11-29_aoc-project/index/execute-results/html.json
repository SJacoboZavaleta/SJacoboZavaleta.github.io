\n`aoc_get_input(day, year)` to get and save the input ^[Adapted from the `advent_input()` function in David Robinson's [**adventdrob**](https://github.com/dgrtwo/adventdrob) package]\nand `aoc_new_day(day, year)` to copy the post template into a new post, \nsubstituting the values of `day` and `year` in the appropriate places. \nI also wrote an `aoc_new_year()` function to set up a new listing page, \nalso from a template.\n\n## A website template\nAt this point, I was really happy with what I'd done for myself, \nand thought it would be nice to make it easy for others to make similar websites\nfor themselves. \nRather than have people clone and adapt my site, \nI created a template repo with the main elements of my site, but without all my solutions, and with custom themes inspired by Christmas colours and the Advent of Code site.^[As opposed to the theme I'd used on my version, which matches the theme of my personal website, and uses paid-for, licensed fonts, which I can't share on GitHub].\n\nThe repo for the template is at <https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template> and the corresponding site is at <https://ellakaye.github.io/advent-of-code-website-template>.\nThe repo has a long README about how to use/adapt the template.\n\n## The aochelpers package\nThe functions I'd written to support the website were originally in a script in the website projects,\nbut as I continued to work both on my site and the template, \nI realised it would be much better to distribute them as a package. \nThat way I wouldn't have to worry about keeping my script in sync with the template script and,\nmore importantly, having the functions in a package makes them much easier to document,\nand to share that documentation in a package website.\n\nAs I worked on the package, I made the functions much more robust than when I'd written them for myself, \nincluding writing various checks and tests.\n\nAs well as functions for managing the website, **aochelpers** also contains functions for reading in the data, \nin various formats well-suited to solving Advent of Code puzzles. \nIn time, I plan to add functions that are useful for solving the puzzles, \nand also (perhaps) for interacting with the Advent of Code website.\n\nSee the package [website](https://ellakaye.github.io/aochelpers) and [repo](https://github.com/EllaKaye/aochelpers) for more details and documentation. There's also a [summary page](../../packages/aochelpers/index.qmd) on this site about it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs often seems to happen with my projects, something that I thought would be quick \n(let's spin out a simple website for my Advent of Code solutions!) \nhas turned into something much larger. It's been a lot of fun, though!\n\nI hope others find the website template and **aochelpers** useful. \nIf you do make a site with them, I'd love to know about it. \nPlease do share in the comments right at the bottom of this page.\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n## Last updated {.appendix}\n \n2023-12-02 20:51:57.172496\n \n## Details {.appendix}\n \n[source code](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk/tree/main/posts/2023-11-25_aoc-project/index.qmd){target='_blank'}, [R environment](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk/tree/main/posts/2023-11-25_aoc-project/renv.lock){target='_blank'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Session info {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Toggle</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31)\n os       macOS Sonoma 14.1\n system   aarch64, darwin20\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       Europe/London\n date     2023-12-02\n pandoc   3.1.1 @ /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n quarto   1.4.515 @ /usr/local/bin/quarto\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n ! package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n P sessioninfo * 1.2.2   2021-12-06 [?] CRAN (R 4.3.0)\n\n [1] /Users/ellakaye/Rprojs/mine/ellakaye-quarto/renv/library/R-4.3/aarch64-apple-darwin20\n [2] /Users/ellakaye/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/renv/sandbox/R-4.3/aarch64-apple-darwin20/ac5c2659\n\n P ── Loaded and on-disk path mismatch.\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n\n",
