We present a number of initiatives, organised under Heather Turner’s ‘Sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) in the R Project’ fellowship, to encourage and train a new, more diverse, generation of contributors. These include R contributor office hours, collaboration campfires, bug BBQs, translatathons and an updated R development guide. This presentation is also a call to action to encourage others to get involved in\nsupporting this language, a fundamental piece of software in many disciplines, used by an estimated two million people.\n\n## Event details\n\n**Event:** [SatRday London 2023](https://satrday-london-2023.jumpingrivers.com)\n\n**Date:** April 22nd, 2023\n\n**Time:** 11:50\n\n**Location:** Bush House, 30 Aldwych, London\n\n\n## Slides\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck ar4x3\" src=\"https://satrday-sustain-r.netlify.app/\" title=\"Sustainability and EDI in the R Project slides\">\n</iframe>\n\nKeyboard shortcuts for slideshow (once you've clicked inside it):\n\n- Use <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> to navigate through the slides\n\n- Use <kbd>o</kbd> for an overview of all slides\n\n- Use <kbd>?</kbd> for an overview more keyboard shortcuts\n\n- Click the hamburger menu in the bottom left corner of the slide deck for more options\n\n  - <kbd>f</kbd> to toggle full screen doesn't work from this page.
