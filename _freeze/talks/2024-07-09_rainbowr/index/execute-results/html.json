In the center, there's a white horizontal band with the text 'rainbowR' written in a playful, multi-colored font. Each letter of 'rainbow' is composed from two geometic shapes in different colours, matching the rainbow stripes in the background, which overlap to make a third colour. The 'R' is from the R language logo. \ndraft: false\n---\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## useR! 2024\n`<a href=\"https://r-lgbtq.github.io/useR-2024/\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-images\"></i> slides</a>`{=html}\n`<a href=\"https://github.com/r-lgbtq/user-2024\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i> materials</a>`{=html}\n\n## posit::conf(2024)\n`<a href=\"https://r-lgbtq.github.io/posit-conf-2024/\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-images\"></i> slides</a>`{=html}\n`<a href=\"https://github.com/r-lgbtq/posit-conf-2024\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i> materials</a>`{=html}\n`<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOEZtIPj6Vk\" class=\"icon-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i class=\"fas fa-play-circle\"></i> video</a>`{=html}\n\n\n\n## Overview \n\nrainbowR is a friendly community for LGBTQ+ folks who code in R. We run monthly online meet-ups where participants chat and share their R work in a supportive environment. We also organise the buddy scheme, which randomly pairs members of the community, to encourage people to meet and connect. We have exciting plans for the future! \n\nYou'll learn about what rainbowR does and how you can get involved, whether as a member of the LGBTQ+ community or as an ally, and hopefully forge new connections at the conference and beyond. We believe the whole R community benefits when that community is diverse and inclusive.\n\n## Event details\n\n**Event:** [useR! 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/)\n\n**Talk listing:** [sched](https://userconf2024.sched.com/event/1c8zs/rainbowr-a-community-that-supports-connects-and-promotes-lgbtq-people-who-code-in-r-ella-kaye-university-of-warwick-hanne-oberman-utrecht-university)\n\n**Date:** July 9th, 2024\n\n**Time:** 13:25\n\n**Location:** Salzburg, Austria\n\nAfter useR! 2024, I pre-record an updated^[Benefitting from the speaker training from Articulation that Posit offers its conference speakers] version of the talk to be played at posit::conf(2024):\n\n**Event:** [posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/)\n\n**Date:** August 13th, 2024\n\n**Time:** 13:00\n\n**Location:** Seattle, USA\n\n## Slides (useR! 2024)\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck ar4x3\" src=\"https://r-lgbtq.github.io/useR-2024/\" title=\"rainbowR lightning talk slides from useR! 2024\">\n</iframe>\n\n## Slides (posit::conf(2024))\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck ar4x3\" src=\"https://r-lgbtq.github.io/posit-conf-2024/\" title=\"rainbowR lightning talk slides from posit::conf(2024)\">\n</iframe>\n\nKeyboard shortcuts for slideshow (once you've clicked inside it):\n\n- Use <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> to navigate through the slides\n\n- Use <kbd>o</kbd> for an overview of all slides\n\n- Use <kbd>?</kbd> for an overview more keyboard shortcuts\n\n- Click the hamburger menu in the bottom left corner of the slide deck for more options\n\n  - <kbd>f</kbd> to toggle full screen doesn't work from this page.
