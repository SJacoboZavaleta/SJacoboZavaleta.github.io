As R users, we may encounter this code when debugging our own code. As R contributors, an understanding of C can enable us to find the root cause of a bug and/or propose a patch to the C code to fix a bug. In any case, learning a new programming language can be fun and rewarding! In this talk, I'll discuss why, as R users/programmers, we may want to learn C, and resources for doing so. I'll show examples of how C is used in the codebase of base R. I'll give an example of how, with only a little C knowledge, it was possible to add a new feature into the R language (specifying colours with three-digit hex codes). Finally, I'll promote the C Study Group for R contributors as a friendly community learning C together.\n\n## Event details\n\n**Event:** [useR! 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/)\n\n**Talk listing:** [sched](https://userconf2024.sched.com/event/1c8zS/c-for-r-users-ella-kaye-university-of-warwick)\n\n**Date:** July 10th, 2024\n\n**Time:** 14:15\n\n**Location:** Salzburg, Austria\n\n## Key points\n\n- Much of base R is written in C\n\n- Knowing some C enables contributions to R by finding the root cause of a bug, which can then be reported and a patch proposed\n\n- A little knowledge of C, and R's C API, can go a long way\n\n\n## Slides\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck ar4x3\" src=\"https://ellakaye.github.io/c-for-r-users/\" title=\"C for R users slide deck\">\n</iframe>\n\nKeyboard shortcuts for slideshow (once you've clicked inside it):\n\n- Use <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> to navigate through the slides\n\n- Use <kbd>o</kbd> for an overview of all slides\n\n- Use <kbd>?</kbd> for an overview more keyboard shortcuts\n\n- Click the hamburger menu in the bottom left corner of the slide deck for more options\n\n  - <kbd>f</kbd> to toggle full screen doesn't work from this page.
