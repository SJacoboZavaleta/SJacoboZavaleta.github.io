They will discuss the importance and difficulties of community-building and why it matters from an EDIA perspective. They will also consider the intersectionality between developing an RSE identity and their identities as members of groups under-represented in the broader RSE community. There will be time for questions and further discussion.\n\n## Event details\n\n**Event:** [DiveRSE](https://diverse-rse.github.io/events/2024-07-31), part of the [seminar series](https://diverse-rse.github.io)\n\n**Date:** July 31st, 2024\n\n**Time:** 15:00\n\n**Location:** Zoom\n\n\n## Slides\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck ar4x3\" src=\"https://ellakaye.github.io/2024-07-31-diverse/\" title=\"Slide deck for the conversation\">\n</iframe>\n\nKeyboard shortcuts for slideshow (once you've clicked inside it):\n\n- Use <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> to navigate through the slides\n\n- Use <kbd>o</kbd> for an overview of all slides\n\n- Use <kbd>?</kbd> for an overview more keyboard shortcuts\n\n- Click the hamburger menu in the bottom left corner of the slide deck for more options\n\n  - <kbd>f</kbd> to toggle full screen doesn't work from this page.
