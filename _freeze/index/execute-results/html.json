My many hats include robotics researcher, artificial intelligence enthusiast, and software developer. Currently, my main hat is that of a developer of cutting-edge healthcare solutions, enhancing medical imaging and robotics, with my research published in esteemed peer-reviewed journals.\n\nüéì Outside of my professional pursuits, I am dedicated to educating others about modern tools for efficient research manuscript writing, including $\\LaTeX$, Zotero, Rmarkdown, Python, and R. Through this website, I aim to share my knowledge and passion for these tools, which are also essential for writing books, blogs, and creating websites with ease using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites).\n\nüå±  This blog serves as a fertile ground for cultivating ideas, thoughts, and projects I'm exploring while pursuing my master's degree in Robotics and Automation. Expect insights on everything from path planning, machine learning, and robot programming to reproducible workflows, and personal reflections on social issues. This space is designed to document what I've learned in classes, notes, projects, ideas, and everything that will help create an extensive vault of ideas for others and for my personal use. As I juggle these diverse interests, I also embrace the joys of films, books, running, and playing video games.\n\nüîç Most of my articles are written in [spanish]{.bg-color-red} to cater to new Hispanic students who may not yet have widespread access to detailed, high-quality information on these topics ü§ñ.\n\n:::\n\n:::",
