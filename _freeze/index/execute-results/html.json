My work blends robotics, artificial intelligence, and software development to enhance medical imaging and healthcare technologies — research that has been published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nBeyond engineering, I’m deeply committed to education. Through this site, I share practical guides on modern academic tools: $\\LaTeX$, Zotero, RMarkdown, Python, and Quarto — especially for Spanish-speaking students navigating research and publication.\n\nThis blog, [La Tercera Fundación]{.bg-color-rose}, is my growing archive of ideas: notes from courses, robotics projects, reproducible workflows, and reflections on science and society. Think of it as a personal library under construction — one that I hope helps others along the way.\n\nWelcome aboard.\n\n:::\n\n:::",
