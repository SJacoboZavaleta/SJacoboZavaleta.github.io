I have used it in extensively in my research as a statistician for visualising, analysing and modelling data. I have also used it for personal projects and writing [packages](packages.qmd). My enthusiasm for all things RMarkdown (especially {distill}) has now morphed into excitement about [Quarto](https://quarto.org){target=\"_blank\"}. I have particularly enjoyed using it to build this website (my fourth!) [^about-1]\n\n[^about-1]: Previous versions were built with blogdown, then hugodown, then distill.\n\nI love the R community!] I am a co-founder and co-organiser of [RainbowR](https://rainbowr.netlify.app) a community that supports, promotes and connects LGBTQ+ people who code in the R language. I am also on the Community team of [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io){target=\"_blank\"}. I am on the organising committee of the [Warwick R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Warwick-useRs/) and was previously co-organiser of the [Oxford R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/). Here's more on the [communities](community.qmd) that I'm involved with, as well as lots of information about and links to groups that you may be interested in getting involved with.\n\nI enjoy sharing what I know/am learning about R with others, particularly by writing blog [posts](posts.qmd) and speaking at [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org) and [R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/pro/r-user-groups/) meetups. Here are some [talks](talks.qmd) I've given. Please [get in touch](contact.qmd) if you'd like me to speak at your group.\n\nI live in Oxford, UK, with my wife and our two young children.\n",
