## Overview 

The R Project is over 20 years old, but its future is not secure ‐ many of the R Core Team are nearing retirement and there are not enough new contributors to sustain the work. We present a number of initiatives, organised under Heather Turner’s ‘Sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) in the R Project’ fellowship, to encourage and train a new, more diverse, generation of contributors. These include R contributor office hours, collaboration campfires, bug BBQs, translatathons and an updated R development guide. This presentation is also a call to action to encourage others to get involved in
supporting this language, a fundamental piece of software in many disciplines, used by an estimated two million people.
