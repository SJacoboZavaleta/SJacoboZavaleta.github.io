## Overview 
In this talk, I will try to convince you that if you have any of your own data or write any of your own R functions, then you should put them into an R package. Benefits include reproducibility and keeping everything together and accessible. Also, it’s really easy to do, and to prove it, I will build a package from scratch before your very eyes. I will also introduce the `bookdown` package for writing reports and even your thesis. Filled with tips and tricks from my own experiences, this talk could save you hours!

## Event details

**Event:** [Birmingham R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/BirminghamR/events/253456048/?gj=co2&rv=co2&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJGE0MGZmNDA5LTFlMjctNDFhNS04ODgzLTM4MGU2ZWViM2Y3OQ)

**Date:** August 8th, 2018

**Time:** 18:00-20:00 GMT+1

**Location:** Faraday Wharf, Innovation Birmingham Campus, Holt Street, Birmingham Science Park, B7 4BB

## Key points

- Put your data and functions in an R package

- R packages are good for reproducibility, for keeping everything together and for sharing

- Existing R packages such as {usethis}, {devtools} {roxygen2} and {testthat} take the friction out of writing your own packages
