## Overview 

Ella Kaye (Research Software Engineer, University of Warwick) and Malvika Sharan (Senior Researcher – Open Research at the Alan Turing Institute and co-lead of The Turing Way) will converse about their experiences in/with the RSE community, as well as both the challenges and successes they’ve encountered when working to improve EDIA. They will discuss the importance and difficulties of community-building and why it matters from an EDIA perspective. They will also consider the intersectionality between developing an RSE identity and their identities as members of groups under-represented in the broader RSE community. There will be time for questions and further discussion.
