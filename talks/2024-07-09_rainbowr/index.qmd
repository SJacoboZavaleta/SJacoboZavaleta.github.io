  A rectangle featuring vertical stripes in the rainbow pride colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. In the center, there's a white horizontal band with the text 'rainbowR' written in a playful, multi-colored font. Each letter of 'rainbow' is composed from two geometic shapes in different colours, matching the rainbow stripes in the background, which overlap to make a third colour. The 'R' is from the R language logo.

## Overview 

rainbowR is a friendly community for LGBTQ+ folks who code in R. We run monthly online meet-ups where participants chat and share their R work in a supportive environment. We also organise the buddy scheme, which randomly pairs members of the community, to encourage people to meet and connect. We have exciting plans for the future! 

You'll learn about what rainbowR does and how you can get involved, whether as a member of the LGBTQ+ community or as an ally, and hopefully forge new connections at the conference and beyond. We believe the whole R community benefits when that community is diverse and inclusive.
