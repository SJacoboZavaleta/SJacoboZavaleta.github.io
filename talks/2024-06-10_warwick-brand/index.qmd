## Overview 

Introducing three related resources, for those affiliated with the University of Warwick to use the university's [brand](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/brand/) in their plots, presentation and websites:

- [**warwickplots**](https://github.com/Warwick-Stats-Resources/warwickplots)

  An R package with colour palettes and a ggplot2 theme
  
- [**warwickpres**](https://github.com/Warwick-Stats-Resources/warwickpres)

  A Quarto Revealjs extension for presentations

- [**warwickcourse**](https://github.com/Warwick-Stats-Resources/warwickcourse)

  A GitHub template for creating course/workshop websites with Quarto

This talk lets you know that these resources *exist*, what they *look* like, gives a quick guide to getting started using them, and lets you know where to learn more.
