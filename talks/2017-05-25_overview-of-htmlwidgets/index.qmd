## Overview 

The [{htmlwidgets}](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/index.html){target="_blank"} package allows developers to create R bindings to JavaScript libraries. The resulting R packages allow the embedding of interactive content in R Markdown documents and Shiny web apps. There are over 50 available widgets. In this talk I give an overview of the `htmlwidget` framework and demonstrate the use of the [{DT}](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/){target="_blank"}, [{leaflet}](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/){target="_blank"} and [{DiagrammeR}](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/){target="_blank"} packages.
