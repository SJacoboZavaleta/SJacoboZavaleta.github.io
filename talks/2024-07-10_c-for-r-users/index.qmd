## Overview 

Much of base R is written in C.  As R users, we may encounter this code when debugging our own code. As R contributors, an understanding of C can enable us to find the root cause of a bug and/or propose a patch to the C code to fix a bug. In any case, learning a new programming language can be fun and rewarding! In this talk, I'll discuss why, as R users/programmers, we may want to learn C, and resources for doing so. I'll show examples of how C is used in the codebase of base R. I'll give an example of how, with only a little C knowledge, it was possible to add a new feature into the R language (specifying colours with three-digit hex codes). Finally, I'll promote the C Study Group for R contributors as a friendly community learning C together.
