[Hello and welcome!]{.home-header}

::: {#about-heading}

:::{grid}

I’m a Mechatronics Engineer passionate about designing innovative clinical robots and biomedical devices. My work blends robotics, artificial intelligence, and software development to enhance medical imaging and healthcare technologies — research that has been published in peer-reviewed journals.

Beyond engineering, I’m deeply committed to education. Through this site, I share practical guides on modern academic tools: $\LaTeX$, Zotero, RMarkdown, Python, and Quarto — especially for Spanish-speaking students navigating research and publication.

This blog, [La Tercera Fundación]{.bg-color-red}, is my growing archive of ideas: notes from courses, robotics projects, reproducible workflows, and reflections on science and society. Think of it as a personal library under construction — one that I hope helps others along the way.

Welcome aboard.
